With *scale*, the curve is multiplied with the actually generated mass/numer of particles (depending on whether *mass* is true or false); the result should then be very similar to the psd() output with actually generated spheres. Discrete non-cumulative PSDs are handled specially: discrete distributions return skypline plot with peaks represented as plateaus of the relative width 1/*num*; continuous distributions return ideal histogram computed for relative bin with 1/*num*; thus returned histogram will match non-cummulative histogram returned by `ParticleGenerator.psd(cumulative=False)`, provided *num* is the same in both cases.")
